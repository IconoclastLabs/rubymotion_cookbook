[RubyMotion Cookbook](http://iconoclastlabs.github.com/rubymotion_cookbook) is our project to learn RubyMotion, iOS development, and to provide a valuable community
resource of code examples. We're experts in none of these things so if you have a suggestion, be gentle, it's
our first time. This is a work in progress.

We'll be following along with the actual *[iOS5 Programming Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021728.do)*
 by Vandad Navandipoor from O'Reilly, 
starting with chapter two, and porting over the Obj-C code examples as we progress through the book. If you have
the book and want to add or correct the project, send us a pull request, we'll gladly accept the help!  Whichever 
chapter you'd like, because as you can tell, we're not going in strict order either.

Additionally, we're aware that [BubbleWrap](https://github.com/mattetti/BubbleWrap) and similar projects exist and 
we're intentionally avoiding them. Wrapping difficult Cocoa libraries with elegant Ruby is a great idea, but we're
attempting to map our examples 1:1 to the cookbook (with creative license) so that the body of the text remains relevant and using an 
external resource defeats that purpose.
